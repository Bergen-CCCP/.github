## Welcome to the Cute Computer Cat Project (CCCP) 👋

### Who Are We 🙋‍♀️
We are a group of students who beleive, for purely wealfare reasons, that the students need a pet. Sadly, a cat for the department is not an option, so we have decided to take matters
into our own hands and build a robotic pet cat.

We are also a group of functional programmers. We have noticed that there are quite a few papers on using functional reactive programming for robotics and computer vision, but we have not
found any good examples or libraries in the open that we can use to build our cat friend.

So, the plan is to merge these two things together and create a cat robot, programmed in Haskell. Our programming aims are:
- Be generic, so that others can use our code
- Use lego because the hardware is pretty standard, but make sure as much of our code would work without lego too
- Publish all of our the libraries, so the masses can create their own functional cat robots


### Where is the code 👩‍💻
The code for the robot will live in the [`Cute Cat`](https://github.com/Bergen-CCCP/Cute-Cat) repository. The other repositories are libraries.
Given that we have only just began, we have published nothing on hackage, but the `Cute Cat` project should automatically clone what you need when you build it with cabal.
